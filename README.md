Search for mathematicians on the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://mathgenealogy.org/) and pull full ancestor and/or descendent academic genealogical data.
The latter functionality is possible thanks to the WebSocket server run by [@davidalber](https://github.com/davidalber), which we access directly [with kind permission](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher/issues/38).
The package also provides functionality to export these genealogical datasets to different plotting environments.

## Installation

The stable binary release can be install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("maths.genealogy")
```

The latest development binary can be installed from R-universe:

``` r
install.packages("maths.genealogy", repos = c("https://louisaslett.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from source on [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("louisaslett/maths.genealogy")
```

## Example

The first task is to identify the ID of the mathematician(s) you would like to build the genealogical data for.
For the author of this package, that would be:

``` r
library("maths.genealogy")

search_id("Aslett", "Louis")
```

Then, one would retrieve the full genealogical tree, using the id identified in the search:

``` r
g <- get_genealogy(171971)
```

The simplest thing would then be to plot the whole genealogical tree:

``` r
plot_grviz(g)
```

Note you can also plot a shared genealogical tree by passing a vector of ids to `get_genealogy()`.
So to see the shared genealogy of the package author and his former postdoc supervisor:

``` r
g <- get_genealogy(c(96119, 171971))
plot_grviz(g)
```

This can be interesting to see where the trees share commonality and link together.
To just hone in on the shortest path:

``` r
plot_gg_path(g)
```

All the above functions take various options (see their documentation), so that for example more than two ids can be passed to `get_genealogy()` and then selective shortest path pairs be plotted with `plot_gg_path()` using appropriate function arguments.
