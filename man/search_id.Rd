\details{
Any one or more of the listed arguments can be provided.
This will trigger an online search against the live \href{https://mathgenealogy.org/}{Mathematics Genealogy Project} database, so please be considerate and do not spam queries.
All the information returned by a standard search on the website is gathered into a data frame and returned, enabling programmatic access to the data.

If you cannot find the individual you are looking for, it could be that they are not in the \href{https://mathgenealogy.org/}{Mathematics Genealogy Project} database.
New data can be submitted by following the instructions in the "How to submit updates" section at \url{https://mathgenealogy.org/submit.php}.
